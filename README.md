# AospLime
## Official devices application

Devices repository: https://github.com/AospLime-Devices

Before you open a pull request to add your device into our list of official devices, you should know a few simple things:

### 1. To turn into a maintainer of AospLime :

1.2 - You must have a way to check your builds, on your own way, having the device, or send the builds for someone test. Completely blind and/or untested builds aren't allowed.

1.3 - Appliers that comproved have the device, will have the preference on taking the maintainship.

1.4 - You must have knowledge of git.

1.5 - You must do an unofficial build and make the device stable for daily usage before applying.

1.6 - You should have your device sources open for us take a look.

1.7 - You mustn't be a placeholder of another maintainer that was removed. The pull request that are considered of that kind won't be accepted.

### 2. Maintainers conduct notes:

2.1 - The maintainers should upload theirs trees on https://github.com/AospLime-Devices

2.2 - The maintainers should test every update before upload in our OTA.

2.3 - The maintainers must keep the authorship of Git commits on everything that they'll make a change, even it's your device tree, kernel or ROM sources. Lots of git commit --amend and force-pushes are acceptable.

2.4 - Relationships fights can be done in PM on Telegram or XDA. 

2.5 - The maintainers also need to add 'export CUSTOM_BUILD_TYPE=OFFICIAL' in their build environment so OTA app will be included.
